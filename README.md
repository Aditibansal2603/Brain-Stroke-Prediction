# Early Identification of Stroke : Project OverviewðŸŽ¯
## Problem statement
Stroke is sometimes termed as brain attack or a cardiovascular accident (CVA). It is much like a heart attack, only it occurs in the brain.<br>

It occurs when the supply of blood to the brain is reduced or blocked completely, which prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients.<br>

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.<br>
Early identification of stroke can help doctors to give necessary medication to the patient.


## Machine Learning problem
Predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.<br>
<b>Type</b> : Supervised Learning<br>
<b>Task</b> : Binary classification<br>
<b>Performance metric</b> : F1 score (since imbalanced classes)<br>

## Methodology
![Methodology](snapshots/Methodology.png)
- Data Collection :- Different datasets from Kaggle were considered. Out of all the existing datasets, an appropriate dataset was selected for model building.
- Data Splitting :- The data is split into training and testing data for better accuracy and efficiency.
- EDA Analysis :- Performed Explanatory Data Analysis only on training set to avoid overfitting. Univariate as well as bivariate analysis is done.
- Data Preprocessing :- The feature and target variables are separated. Feature variables are further divided into numerical and categorical features. Also, filling missing data via *K-nearest neighbours imputation*.
- Feature Engineering :- Performed 3 transformations in it
1. Discretization :- For replacing the continuous values with a finite set of values.
2. OneHot Encoding :- For replacing categorical column(s) with the binary value for each category.
3. Feature Scaling :- For standardizing the numerical features.
- Model Training :- *Decision Tree Classifier* and *Logistic Regression* algorithm are used to build the model.
- Hyperparameter Tuning :- Used *RandomizedSearchCV* to tune the hyperparameters of both the models with f1 score as the evaluation metrics.
- Deployment - Used HTML and flask to develop a user-friendly page for the user to enter the input parameters and get the result.

## Result
**A web application to predict the chances of getting stroke by a patient based on other health factors like hypertension, Smoking habit, etc.**
- Live app :- https://brain-stroke-aditi-101803650.herokuapp.com/
- The model was trained and validated on 5100+ patient health records
- Achieved True Positive rate of 0.77 and F1 score of 0.24

## Novelty
- For both models, performed *Hyperparameter Tuning*
1. Decision tree classifier parameters: maximum depth, criterion, minimum sample split, maximum features, maximum leaf nodes, class weight.
2. Logistic regression parameters: penalty, C, fit intercept, and solver
- Used *k-fold cross validation* technique to evaluate the machine learning models
